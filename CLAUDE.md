# Leadgen Pipeline - Project Rules

<!-- sdlc-tier: product -->
<!-- backlog-project: leadgen-pipeline -->
<!-- governance-from: backlog -->

> This project uses the **global SDLC plugin** for feature specs (`/spec`), backlog management (`/backlog`), product strategy (`/pm`), technical health (`/em`), and design review (`/pd`). Project-specific rules below override or extend the global workflow. The `/roadmap` skill is project-local.

## Session Start

Call `backlog_onboard("leadgen-pipeline")` at session start to load full governance context including directives, process documents, routing tables, sprint status, and recommended next items.

## Hard Rules (Enforced by Tooling)

- **No direct writes to main** — GitHub branch protection requires PR with 1 approval + CI passing (lint + test).
- **No production deploys from feature branches** — `deploy-api.sh` and `deploy-dashboard.sh` refuse non-main branches.
- **Stay in your worktree** — `git checkout main` and `git switch main` are denied. Always verify: `git branch --show-current`
- **Only rebase onto `origin/staging`** — `git rebase main` and `git rebase origin/main` are blocked. Feature branches always rebase onto `origin/staging`. Use `make sync`.
- **Sync before starting work** — If SessionStart shows "N commits behind origin/staging", run `make sync` before writing any code.
- **Verify before handoff** — Use `/validate` after implementation. Work is not done until the validation report says READY.
- **Lead agent NEVER does work** — In delegation mode, the lead coordinator NEVER reads source files, writes code, calls MCP tools for data gathering, runs bash commands, or does any extensive work (more than 1 tool call). ALL work is delegated to spawned agents. "Let me just read this first" is building. Delegate it.
- **Start every session from the backlog** — The backlog service at `https://backlog.visionvolve.com/leadgen-pipeline/` is the source of truth. Use `backlog_onboard` MCP tool or check the dashboard to see sprint status, then pick up from there. Never start work without consulting the backlog.
- **Everything goes through the backlog** — When the user requests a new feature, improvement, or reports a bug: (1) Use `backlog_create_item` MCP tool (or `/backlog <idea>`), (2) Assign priority (Must Have/Should Have/Could Have), (3) Write a spec (problem, acceptance criteria, technical approach), (4) Assign to a sprint. **No implementation starts without a backlog entry and spec.** Even single-line bug fixes get a backlog entry (lightweight: problem + fix + test plan). The backlog service is the single source of truth.
- **Specs before code — always**:
  - **Features/enrichers/new functionality**: Full spec required (problem statement, user stories, acceptance criteria Given/When/Then, data model changes, API contracts, UI wireframes). No code until spec is written and reviewed.
  - **Bug fixes/hotfixes**: Lightweight spec required (problem + fix + test plan). Can be written in batch for sprint bug-fix items. No code until spec exists.
  - **Single-line fixes**: Inline spec in the commit message is acceptable (problem + fix + verification).
- **Agents must self-test before handoff** — Before notifying the user or asking them to test anything, agents MUST: (1) Run ALL tests in the current sprint test script (`docs/testing/sprint-{N}-manual-tests.md`), (2) Mark each test PASS or FAIL, (3) Fix any FAIL and redeploy before proceeding, (4) Only notify the user after ALL tests pass or after documenting unfixable issues with a clear explanation. **Never ask the user to test something you haven't tested yourself first.**

## Branch Model

```
main ──────────────────────────────── production (deploy-api.sh, deploy-dashboard.sh)
  ↑ PR (requires CI pass + 1 approval)
staging ───────────────────────────── latest beta (deploy-revision.sh → staging VPS)
  ↑ PR (feature branches merge here)
feature/* ─────────────────────────── agent work (deploy-revision.sh → staging VPS under /rev-{slug}/)
hotfix/*  ─────────────────────────── urgent fixes (can PR directly to main)
```

| Branch | Merges to | Deploy target | CI required |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| `feature/*` | `staging` via PR | Staging as `/rev-{slug}/` | Yes (on push) |
| `hotfix/*` | `main` via PR | Staging first, then production | Yes (required for merge) |
| `staging` | `main` via PR | Staging as "latest beta" | Yes (required for merge) |
| `main` | — | Production | — |

## Multi-Worktree Setup

- **Parallel work uses git worktrees** — multiple Claude instances run simultaneously on different features
- Worktree directory: `.worktrees/` (gitignored, project-local)
- **CRITICAL: Never `git checkout` or `git switch` branches.** You will corrupt other instances' work.
- Verify you're in the correct worktree: `git branch --show-current`

**Creating a new worktree:**
```bash
git worktree add .worktrees/{feature-name} -b feature/{feature-name} staging
cd .worktrees/{feature-name}
```

**Using an existing worktree:**
```bash
cd /Users/michal/git/leadgen-pipeline/.worktrees/{feature-name}
```

**Merging (Pull Requests Only):**
- NEVER merge locally. Multiple Claude instances work in parallel.
- Feature → staging via PR, hotfix → main via PR, staging → main via PR.
- After merge: `git worktree remove .worktrees/{feature-name}`
- Merge conflicts: rebase in the worktree, `git rebase origin/staging && git push --force-with-lease`

**Port slots for parallel dev servers:**

| Slot | Flask | Vite | Usage |
|------|-------|------|-------|
| 0 | 5001 | 5173 | Main worktree (default) |
| 1 | 5002 | 5174 | Feature worktree 1 |
| 2 | 5003 | 5175 | Feature worktree 2 |
| N | 5001+N | 5173+N | Nth worktree |

**Safety hooks** (`.claude/settings.json`):
- **SessionStart**: Injects branch, staleness vs origin/staging, active agents
- **UserPromptSubmit**: Re-injects branch on every user message
- **PreToolUse guard (Write/Edit)**: Warns on files outside worktree, detects cross-worktree conflicts
- **PreToolUse guard (Bash)**: Blocks `git rebase main/master`

**Agent registry** (`.worktrees/registry.json`): Auto-populated, `make agents` to list.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Flask + SQLAlchemy + PostgreSQL (RDS)
- **Frontend**: React SPA (Vite) + vanilla HTML pages — served by Caddy
- **Orchestration**: n8n (self-hosted) for enrichment pipeline workflows
- **Deployment**: Docker on VPS, Caddy reverse proxy
- **Auth**: JWT (bcrypt passwords, access + refresh tokens)
- **Multi-tenant**: Shared PG schema with `tenant_id` column + namespace URL routing
- **CI**: GitHub Actions (ruff lint + pytest on push/PR)

## Product Vision

The product vision is documented at `docs/vision/index.html` — a self-contained microsite describing the closed-loop GTM engine (Try → Run → Evaluate → Improve).

**Consult this vision when making design decisions.** Every feature should move us closer to:
- AI as proactive strategist, not passive tool
- Closed-loop learning from campaign results
- Zero busywork for the founder (auto-save, auto-extract, guided flow)
- Multi-phase workflow: Strategy → Contacts → Messages → Campaign

Key design principles from the vision:
- The founder is the CEO, the AI is the strategist
- Every interaction should gather a decision or deliver a result
- The AI gets smarter with every cycle
- Never show harsh/judgmental language about prospects or companies

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop (for PostgreSQL)
- Python 3.13+ with pip
- Node.js 20+ with npm

### One-Time Setup

```bash
bash scripts/init-env.sh    # Pull secrets from VPS → .env.dev
make db-pull                 # Pull staging DB to local PG (port 5433)
cd frontend && npm install   # Install frontend deps + Playwright
npx playwright install       # Install browser binaries
```

### Quick Start

```bash
make dev         # Start PG + Flask (auto-reload) + Vite (HMR)
```

Opens:
- Dashboard: http://localhost:5173
- API: http://localhost:5001/api/health
- Login: `test@staging.local` / `staging123`

### Local-First Development (MANDATORY)

**All code MUST be tested locally before any staging deployment.** This is non-negotiable.

**Workflow:**
1. `make dev` — start local servers (Flask auto-reload + Vite HMR)
2. Code changes appear instantly — no build step, no Docker rebuild
3. Test in browser at `http://localhost:5173` (login: `test@staging.local` / `staging123`)
4. Run `make test-changed` for unit tests
5. Only after local verification → deploy revision to staging

**Setup (one-time per machine):**
```bash
bash scripts/init-env.sh    # Pull all API tokens/secrets from staging VPS → .env.dev
make db-pull                 # Clone staging database to local PostgreSQL
cd frontend && npm install   # Frontend dependencies
```

**What hot-reloads:**
- Python backend: Flask auto-reload watches `api/` — save a file, server restarts in <1s
- React frontend: Vite HMR watches `frontend/src/` — save a file, browser updates instantly
- No Docker rebuild needed for code changes

**What requires restart:**
- `.env.dev` changes → restart Flask (`make dev` again)
- New Python dependencies → `pip install` + restart Flask
- Database schema changes → run migration SQL against local PG

### Running Tests

```bash
make test           # Unit tests — full suite (pytest)
make test-changed   # Unit tests — only changed files vs origin/staging
make test-e2e       # Playwright browser tests (requires make dev running)
make test-all       # Full unit + enrichment + E2E
make lint           # Ruff + ESLint — full
make lint-changed   # Ruff — only changed Python files
```

### Testing Strategy — Context-Aware by Default

**During development (feature branches):**
- Use `make test-changed` — auto-detects changed files vs origin/staging and runs only matching tests
- Use `make lint-changed` — lints only changed Python files
- Frontend: `cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit` (type check only)
- **NEVER run `make test` or full pytest suite** during feature development — it wastes 5+ minutes
- **NEVER run E2E tests** per feature — E2E runs only at sprint completion

**CI/CD for staging PRs (context-aware):**
- GitHub Actions detects changed `.py` files and maps them to test files
- Only changed Python files are linted (ruff check + format)
- Frontend TypeScript check runs only when `.ts`/`.tsx` files changed
- ESLint is skipped (runs only on main PRs)
- **No E2E** — E2E runs at sprint completion, not per PR

**CI/CD for main PRs (full suite):**
- Full `pytest tests/unit/` — all unit tests
- Full `ruff check api/` + `ruff format --check api/` — all Python lint
- Full `npx tsc --noEmit` + `npm run lint` — TypeScript + ESLint
- Full E2E suite — this is the quality gate
- This is the ONLY time full suite runs

**Sprint completion (E2E validation):**
- After all sprint PRs merged to staging
- Run full E2E baseline + deep workflow tests against staging root
- Validates sprint scope delivered with no regression
- If E2E fails, fix and retest before merging staging → main

### Database

```bash
make db-pull     # Refresh local DB from staging
make db-reset    # Empty local DB (then db-pull to restore)
```

### Dev-First Workflow (ENFORCED)

1. **Start local servers** — `make dev` (or `DEV_SLOT=N make dev` in a worktree)
2. **Code with hot reload** — Vite picks up React changes instantly (<100ms), Flask auto-reloads Python (<1s)
3. **Test in browser** — `http://localhost:5173` — verify UI behavior manually
4. **Run unit tests** — `make test-changed` (fast, SQLite in-memory, ~10s)
5. **Only then deploy** — `deploy-revision.sh` for staging acceptance testing
6. **E2E at sprint end** — never per feature, never per PR

**Anti-patterns (DO NOT):**
- Deploy to staging to "see if it works" — test locally first
- Skip browser testing — unit tests don't catch UI regressions
- Run full test suite — `make test-changed` is sufficient during development
- Rebuild Docker images for code changes — hot reload handles it

### Worktree Commands

```bash
bash scripts/worktree.sh my-feature   # Create worktree + set tab title + launch Claude
bash scripts/worktree.sh --list       # List active worktrees
DEV_SLOT=1 make dev                   # Start Flask+Vite on slot 1
DEV_SLOT=1 make test-e2e              # Run E2E tests against slot 1
make dev-status                        # Show all active slots + PG status
make agents                            # List active agents (from registry)
make pr-scan                           # Check open PRs for file conflicts
```

## Deployment Rules

**Claude must NEVER run deploy scripts directly.** Use `/deploy` skill instead.

**Local verification gate**: Before deploying ANY revision to staging, the developer (or agent) MUST have:
1. Tested the change locally with `make dev`
2. Verified the UI works in browser (not just unit tests)
3. Run `make test-changed` with all tests passing

Staging deployments without local verification are blocked. This prevents wasted deploy cycles.

Forbidden commands:
- `bash deploy/deploy-api.sh`
- `bash deploy/deploy-dashboard.sh`
- `bash deploy/deploy-revision.sh`

| Branch | Deploy target | Checks |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| `feature/*` | BLOCKED | Run locally with `make dev` |
| `staging` | Staging VPS | All committed, tests pass |
| `main` | Production | All committed, tests pass, user confirms |

**Testing requirement**: After every staging deployment, agents MUST run the sprint test script before notifying the user. See Hard Rules — "Agents must self-test before handoff."

### Staging Rev Deployments

- **Root** always serves the latest staging commit (dashboard + API)
- **Feature branches** deploy API-only as `/api-rev-{commit}/` — test via `?rev={commit}` query param
- The `?rev=` param makes the dashboard route API calls to the revision's backend

## Infrastructure

cd /Users/michal/git/visionvolve-vps && bash scripts/deploy-caddy.sh
```

## Sprint Methodology

Work is organized in **sprints** — batches of backlog items grouped to maximize parallelization and minimize deployment/testing overhead.

### Sprint Planning (Lead Agent Decides)

The lead agent plans each sprint by:
1. **Selecting items from backlog** — group items that share dependencies, touch the same systems, or can be deployed together
2. **Sizing the team** — decide how many engineers based on sprint scope (2-6 typical)
3. **Mapping parallelism** — identify which items can run simultaneously vs which must be sequential
4. **Batching deploys** — group items so they deploy and test together (1 staging deploy per sprint, not per item)

### Sprint Team Composition (Mandatory)

Every sprint has these roles (spawned as agents):

| Role | Agent Type | Responsibility |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| **PM** | `sdlc:pm-analyst` | Scope validation, acceptance criteria, user story clarity |
| **EM** | `sdlc:em-analyst` | Architecture review, code review, technical strategy alignment |
| **PD** | `sdlc:pd-analyst` | UX review, design consistency, accessibility |
| **QA** | `general-purpose` | E2E tests, staging verification, regression testing |
| **Engineers (N)** | `general-purpose` | Implementation, unit tests, lint — one per parallel track |

Lead decides N (engineers) based on how many items can run in parallel. PM, EM, PD, QA are always present.

### Sprint Lifecycle

```
1. PLAN        Lead selects items, maps dependencies, sizes team
2. SPEC CHECK  PM + EM + PD verify specs meet Development-Ready gates
3. IMPLEMENT   Engineers build in parallel (separate worktrees)
4. REVIEW      EM runs code review + security scan on all PRs
5. DESIGN QA   PD reviews UI/UX on all frontend changes
6. DEPLOY      QA deploys all PRs to staging (batched)
7. E2E TEST    QA runs Playwright + acceptance criteria on staging
8. MERGE       All PRs merged to staging together
9. RETRO       Lead updates backlog, captures learnings
```

### Optimization Rules

- **Batch dependencies**: If B depends on A, put them in the same sprint — A builds first, B starts when A's PR is ready (not merged)
- **Minimize deploy cycles**: One staging deploy per sprint (merge all PRs, deploy once, test once)
- **Parallel worktrees**: Each engineer gets their own worktree — no blocking on shared branches
- **Shared base**: If items share a dependency PR, later items branch from that PR's branch (not staging)
- **Gate batching**: Run code review + security scan on ALL sprint PRs at once (one EM pass, not N passes)

### Agent Context Rules (CRITICAL)

**Every spawned agent starts with FRESH context.** Agents cannot see the conversation history, backlog discussions, or decisions made in the lead's session. The lead MUST pass all relevant context explicitly.

**What to include in every agent prompt:**
1. **Task scope** — exactly what to build/research, no ambiguity
2. **Relevant specs** — paste or reference the spec sections that apply (don't say "see the design doc" — quote the relevant parts or tell them which file + section to read)
3. **Architecture decisions** — any decisions from this session that affect the work (e.g., "chat is app-level not page-level", "no n8n, Python only")
4. **File locations** — exact paths to read, create, or modify
5. **Acceptance criteria** — what "done" looks like for this specific task
6. **Constraints** — what NOT to do (e.g., "don't touch PlaybookPage.tsx, it's being refactored by another agent")
7. **Workflow** — exact steps: implement → test → lint → commit → push → PR → report
8. **Local testing** — remind agent to test locally with `make dev` before any staging deployment. Include: `Test locally first: make dev → verify in browser at localhost:5173 → make test-changed → only then deploy.`

**What NOT to assume agents know:**
- Previous agent results (pass them explicitly)
- Backlog item details (quote the relevant task)
- Design decisions from chat (state them as facts)
- Other agents' work (list what's in flight and what to avoid)

**Anti-pattern**: "Build the auto-save feature" (agent has no context)
**Correct**: Full prompt with setup steps, files to read, what to change, acceptance criteria, test commands, and workflow.

### Sprint Sizing Guide

| Sprint Size | Engineers | Items | Duration |
|-------------|-----------|-------|----------|
| Small | 2 | 2-3 items | ~1 session |
| Medium | 3-4 | 4-6 items | ~2 sessions |
| Large | 5-6 | 7-10 items | ~3 sessions |

### Live Backlog Dashboard

The backlog dashboard at `https://backlog.visionvolve.com/leadgen-pipeline/` shows:
- All items with priority, effort, status, dependencies, assignee
- Sprint groupings with progress tracking
- Kanban and table views with filters
- Auto-refreshes from embedded JSON (future: `/api/backlog` endpoint)

## Definition of Development-Ready

A feature is **development-ready** when ALL of the following are complete. No code is written until this gate passes.

1. **Full specification** (features/new functionality) — Written spec with: problem statement, user stories, acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then), data model changes, API contracts, UI wireframes or descriptions
   **Lightweight specification** (bug fixes) — Written spec with: problem statement, exact fix description, acceptance criteria, test plan. Can be batched for sprint bug-fix items.
2. **Product strategy alignment** — Reviewed against `docs/vision/index.html` and `PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md`. The feature moves us closer to the north star, not sideways.
3. **Technical strategy alignment** — Reviewed against `docs/TECHNICAL_STRATEGY.md`. No architectural contradictions, tech debt is acknowledged and planned for.
4. **Usability perspective** — UX flow reviewed: is this zero-busywork? Does every interaction gather a decision or deliver a result? Accessibility considered.
5. **Challenge round 1** — Spec presented to a critical reviewer (agent or human). Questions answered, gaps filled, scope trimmed if needed.
6. **Challenge round 2** — Revised spec re-reviewed. Reviewer confirms: "This is ready to build." No open questions remain.

**Skip conditions**: Hotfixes and single-line bug fixes can skip to a lightweight version (problem + fix + test plan).

## Pre-PR Quality Gates (Synced from Governance)

Gate sequence (mandatory before any PR):

1. **Spec compliance**: spec-reviewer agent approves (COMPLIANT verdict)
2. **Code quality + Security** (parallel):
   - feature-dev:code-reviewer (confidence >= 80%)
   - security-scanner agent (no Critical/Important findings)
3. **QA**: unit tests pass (`make test-changed`); E2E runs at sprint completion, not per PR
4. **Docs**: ARCHITECTURE.md, CHANGELOG.md, ADR (if applicable) updated
5. **Backlog**: items updated to Done

Gate order: spec compliance -> code quality + security (parallel) -> QA -> docs -> backlog

### Test Requirements

- All new code must have unit tests (TDD preferred)
- Run: `make test-changed` (context-aware unit tests)
- All lint checks pass: `make lint-changed` (changed files) or `make lint` (full, pre-merge)
- E2E (Playwright) runs at sprint completion only — after all sprint PRs merge to staging

## Definition of Done (Project-Specific Detail)

A feature is **done** when ALL quality gates above pass AND:

### Local Verification (before staging)
- [ ] Tested with `make dev` — hot reload, no Docker rebuild
- [ ] UI verified in browser at `localhost:5173`
- [ ] `make test-changed` passes
- [ ] `make lint-changed` passes

### Staging Verification
- [ ] Deployed to staging revision (`deploy-revision.sh`)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria verified against the revision (manual or targeted Playwright spec)
- [ ] Tear down revision container after verification (free staging resources)
- [ ] Full E2E regression — runs at sprint completion after all PRs merge, NOT per feature

### Security Audit
- [ ] Input validation at all system boundaries
- [ ] No secrets in code, no hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Auth/authz checks on all new endpoints

### Merge to Staging
- [ ] PR created to staging with passing CI
- [ ] PR approved (1 approval required)
- [ ] Merged to staging
- [ ] Staging root deployment verified (auto-deploys on merge)
- [ ] User notified: "Feature X is ready for testing on staging"

### Testing Responsibilities
- **Agents do**: Deploy to staging revision, verify acceptance criteria against revision, tear down revision, code review, security audit, merge to staging
- **Sprint QA agent does**: Run full E2E suite AFTER all sprint PRs merged to staging — validates sprint scope + no regression
- **User does**: Manual testing on staging root AFTER sprint QA passes. User tests the integrated experience, not individual revisions.
- **Flow**: Agent builds -> Agent deploys rev -> Agent verifies acceptance criteria -> Agent reviews -> Agent merges to staging -> Sprint QA runs E2E -> User tests on staging root
- **E2E is sprint-level**: Never run E2E per feature or per PR — it runs once per sprint after all items land
- **Manual test scripts**: `docs/testing/sprint-{N}-manual-tests.md` -- used by the user for staging root testing

## Code Standards

- Python: PEP 8, type hints encouraged on public functions
- JS: ES5 compatible (no build step, vanilla JS)
- SQL: Lowercase keywords, snake_case names
- No over-engineering — minimum complexity for current requirements
- Security: validate at system boundaries, never trust client input

## Agent Workflow Discipline (Synced from Governance)

### Agent Backlog Assignment

When an SDLC agent starts execution on a backlog item:

1. **Claim immediately**: Call `backlog_claim_item` with the item short_id before writing any code. Status stays as-is (e.g., Spec'd) — claiming does NOT change status.
2. **Set Building**: Call `backlog_update_item(status='Building')` as the very first code action. This signals work has started.
3. **Set PR Open**: Call `backlog_update_item(status='PR Open')` when branch is pushed and PR is created.
4. **Set Done**: Call `backlog_update_item(status='Done')` when PR is merged to staging.
5. **Release claim**: Call `backlog_release_item` after Done is set.

This is non-negotiable. No agent works on an item without claiming it first. This prevents duplicate work and gives the team visibility into who is working on what.

### Status Transitions

- Spec'd → Building (agent calls `backlog_update_item(status='Building')` after claiming)
- Idea → Building (same, for items not yet spec'd)
- Building → PR Open (when branch pushed + PR created)
- PR Open → Done (when merged to staging)

Note: `backlog_claim_item` does NOT change status. Status must be updated explicitly at each transition.

### Sprint Assignment

Items must be assigned to a sprint before execution begins. Unscheduled items should not be picked up without explicit user approval.

## Team Delegation Mode Rules (Synced from Governance)

### Core Rule

When operating in team/delegate/swarm mode, the lead coordinator NEVER directly:
- Reads, edits, or writes source code
- Runs git operations (commit, push, diff)
- Runs deployment commands
- Does diagnostics (docker logs, API checks)

### Lead Coordinator ONLY Does

- Decomposes work into tasks (TaskCreate)
- Spawns agents with full context (run_in_background: true)
- Synthesizes agent outputs into user-facing summaries
- Asks clarifying questions (AskUserQuestion)
- Routes messages between agents (SendMessage)
- Enforces quality gates

### Non-Blocking Rule

After spawning a teammate or sending a message, immediately return control to the user. Never wait for agent completion before responding.

### Agent Types

- `general-purpose`: implementation, deploys, git, diagnostics
- `Explore`: research and investigation only (no edits)
