  "description": "Machine learning feedback loop where the AI strategist learns from every interaction and campaign outcome at both individual user and platform-wide levels. First customer gets a good strategist. Hundredth customer gets an exceptional one. - Track what approaches/angles/channels worked for this specific user's market and audience - Remember past campaigns: \"We tried approach X, reply rate was 2%. Approach Y got 8%.\" - Adapt recommendations based on proven results: \"For your DACH manufacturing prospects, ROI framing outperforms innovation framing 4:1\" - Learn buyer persona preferences: \"Marketing Directors respond to case studies, CTOs respond to technical whitepapers\" - Build a feedback loop: strategy → outreach → results → refined strategy - Aggregate anonymized performance data across all customers - Surface platform-wide insights: \"LinkedIn outperforms cold email 3:1 for German market\" - Best practices emerge from data, not assumptions: send times, message length, subject lines - Industry-specific benchmarks: \"SaaS companies targeting SMB see 12% reply rate average\" - Every customer's wins improve every other customer's recommendations - Outcome tracking: link campaign results (reply rates, meetings booked, deals closed) back to strategy decisions - Feedback ingestion: user marks what worked/didn't after campaign runs - Model fine-tuning or RAG: inject proven patterns into system prompts - A/B testing engine: automatically test variations and learn from results - Benchmarking dashboard: show how user's metrics compare to anonymized platform averages _No items yet._",
