  "spec": "## Transparent AI Thinking (Tool Calls, Reasoning)\n\n### Goal\nShow the user what the AI is doing behind the scenes — which tools it's calling, what data it's reading, and its reasoning process.\n\n### Behavior\n- **Thinking indicator**: Animated \"thinking\" state while AI processes\n- **Tool call cards**: Inline cards showing \"Reading strategy doc...\", \"Searching 847 contacts...\", \"Updating ICP field...\"\n- **Expandable detail**: Click a tool card to see the raw input/output\n- **Reasoning traces**: Optional \"Show reasoning\" toggle displays the AI's chain of thought\n\n### Technical Approach\n- Stream tool_use events from the API via SSE (Server-Sent Events)\n- `ToolCallCard` component: icon, name, status (running/done/error), expandable body\n- Reasoning: Use Claude's `thinking` blocks if available, else parse from response\n- State machine: `idle -> thinking -> tool_calling -> responding`\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- Given the AI calls `search_contacts`, the user sees \"Searching contacts...\" before the result\n- Given a multi-tool response, each tool call appears as a separate card in sequence\n- Given the user clicks a tool card, raw input/output JSON is shown",
