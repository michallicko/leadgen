  "description": "Cost-optimized scheduled contact freshness system. **Tier 1 (cheap cron)**: Periodic lightweight probes on critical time-sensitive attributes only — email deliverability (SMTP/MX check), LinkedIn profile delta detection (title/company changed), company domain/website status (still active, redirects, new content), and job posting signals (company hiring for the contact's role = possible departure). **Tier 2 (selective deep refresh)**: Only contacts where Tier 1 detects a change get flagged for full re-enrichment via the modular pipeline (BL-016). Configurable per tenant: scan frequency, credit budget cap, change sensitivity threshold. Optimizes for cost — spend credits only where something actually changed.",
