  "spec": "## Intelligent Auto-Extraction\n\n### Goal\nAutomatically extract structured fields (ICP, pain points, value props) from the free-text strategy body using AI.\n\n### Behavior\n- **Trigger**: After auto-save completes, if body changed significantly (>50 chars delta)\n- **Extraction**: AI reads strategy body and populates/updates structured fields\n- **Review**: Extracted values appear as suggestions (yellow highlight) until user confirms\n- **Scope**: ICP, industry, company size, pain points, value propositions, key messaging\n\n### Technical Approach\n- Background job triggered by save webhook\n- Claude API with structured output (JSON schema)\n- Diff extracted fields against current values; only suggest changes\n- `PATCH /api/strategies/:id/suggestions` stores pending suggestions\n- UI shows inline diff with Accept/Reject per field\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- Given a user writes a strategy paragraph mentioning \"Series A SaaS companies with 50-200 employees\", when auto-save fires, then ICP fields are suggested with those values\n- Given extracted values match existing fields, then no suggestion is created (no noise)\n- Given user rejects a suggestion, it is not re-suggested unless the source text changes",
