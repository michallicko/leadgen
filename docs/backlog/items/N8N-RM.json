  "spec": "## Remove n8n -> Python Orchestration\n\n### Goal\nReplace the n8n-based enrichment pipeline with a native Python orchestration layer, reducing infrastructure complexity and improving debuggability.\n\n### Scope\n- **Migrate 6 workflows**: Orchestrator, L1 Company, L2 Company, L2 Person, Progress Store, Batch APIs\n- **Python orchestrator**: Celery (or dramatiq) task queue with Redis broker\n- **Direct API calls**: Replace n8n HTTP nodes with Python `httpx` calls to Perplexity, Anthropic, Airtable\n- **Progress**: WebSocket push instead of n8n webhook polling\n- **Monitoring**: Structured logging + Sentry for error tracking\n\n### Migration Strategy\n1. Build Python orchestrator alongside n8n (parallel run)\n2. A/B test: route 10% of batches to Python\n3. Validate results match n8n output\n4. Cut over and decommission n8n\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- Given a batch is triggered, the Python orchestrator produces identical enrichment results to n8n\n- Given a sub-workflow fails, retries happen automatically with exponential backoff\n- Given the migration is complete, n8n container is removed and VPS RAM usage drops by ~500MB",
