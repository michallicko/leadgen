  "description": "Phase UI from PR #39 is completely absent from the staging deployment. No phase stepper is visible on the playbook page. Navigating to sub-routes like /playbook/campaign shows a blank page.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Login to staging, navigate to /visionvolve/playbook\n2. Look at the top of the page — no phase stepper (Strategy > Contacts > Messages > Campaign)\n3. Only 'ICP Playbook' heading with Extract button is visible\n4. Navigate to /visionvolve/playbook/campaign\n5. Page shows completely blank (black screen)\n6. Console shows: 'No routes matched location /visionvolve/playbook/campaign'\n\n### Expected\n- Horizontal phase stepper at top of playbook page\n- Strategy phase highlighted as active\n- Locked phases (Contacts, Messages, Campaign) grayed out\n- Sub-routes redirect to current phase instead of blank page\n\n### Actual\n- No phase stepper anywhere on the page\n- Sub-routes show blank page with 'No routes matched' console warning\n- URL stays at the invalid route (no redirect)\n\n### Root Cause Hypothesis\nPhase UI components (PhaseIndicator, PhasePanel) from PR #39 were not included in the deployed frontend build. Also depends on PR #37 (BL-064) for API phase data.",
