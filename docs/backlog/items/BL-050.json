  "description": "Full cursor presence and live document sync using Yjs + Hocuspocus (Tiptap's native CRDT stack). Multiple users editing the same playbook see each other's cursors, selections, and changes in real time. WebSocket sync server for document state. Backend persists CRDT document state (binary Yjs format), replacing the current `content` column approach. Supersedes the old version conflict detection pattern. Core product differentiator for collaborative GTM strategy work. Playbook backlog: PB-036.",
