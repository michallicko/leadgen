  "spec": "## Smart Onboarding (Discovery Qs Before Draft)\n\n### Goal\nWhen a user creates a new strategy, the AI asks targeted discovery questions before drafting anything — acting like a real strategist's first meeting.\n\n### Behavior\n- **Guided flow**: 5-7 questions asked one at a time (not a form)\n- **Adaptive**: Questions change based on previous answers (\"You mentioned SaaS — B2B or B2C?\")\n- **Draft generation**: After discovery, AI auto-generates the first strategy draft\n- **Skip option**: Experienced users can skip with \"I'll write it myself\"\n\n### Question Sequence (adaptive)\n1. What does your company do? (elevator pitch)\n2. Who is your ideal customer? (role, company type, size)\n3. What problem do you solve for them?\n4. What channels do you currently use for outreach?\n5. What's working? What isn't?\n6. What's your primary goal for the next 90 days?\n7. Any competitors we should be aware of?\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- Given a new strategy is created, the AI starts with question 1 instead of a blank doc\n- Given the user answers all questions, a complete strategy draft is generated automatically\n- Given the user says \"skip\", they get an empty strategy doc template",
