  "description": "Voice-based interaction mode where the AI speaks to the user in their native language and guides them through the full GTM workflow (strategy → contact sourcing → campaign prep) via voice dialog. Designed for busy company owners who want to work while driving, commuting, or otherwise hands-free. Key features: - Voice input/output in user's native language (Czech, German, English, etc.) - AI narrates what's happening: \"I've found 12 companies matching your ICP in the DACH region. The top 3 are...\" - User makes key decisions by voice: \"Focus on the manufacturing ones\" / \"Skip that one\" - Full workflow coverage: create strategy, source contacts, prepare outreach — all voice-guided - Session continuity: pick up where you left off - Async handoff: voice session creates actionable items that can be reviewed later on desktop Use case: Company owner driving 2 hours wants to create a GTM strategy, source a contact list, and prepare everything for campaign launch by the time they arrive. - Real-time, natural conversation — not text-to-speech bolted on - Low latency (near-instant response, no awkward pauses) - Interruption support (user can cut in, AI adapts) - Natural prosody (varies tone, pace, emphasis — not monotone TTS) - Multilingual fluency (switches between English/Czech/German naturally mid-conversation) - Context awareness (remembers prior conversation, references past points) - \"Thinking out loud\" narration (\"Let me look at your contacts... okay, I see 3 that match...\") - Technology candidates: OpenAI Realtime API, ElevenLabs Conversational AI, or equivalent native voice-to-voice model - Basic TTS/STT pipelines are NOT acceptable — this must feel like talking to a real person - Animated AI avatar with voice that serves as a virtual team member, not just a chatbot - Creates sense of presence and accountability — \"someone is working on this\" - Avatar narrates progress: \"I'm analyzing your ICP now... found 3 strong segments\" - Expressive — shows thinking, excitement about good findings, concern about gaps - Designed for AI-first founders who spend 8+ hours/day working with AI and need human-like interaction to avoid isolation - Technologies to explore: ElevenLabs (voice), HeyGen/Synthesia (avatar), WebRTC (real-time), or lightweight animated character (lower cost) - Could be a browser tab, mobile app, or even a desktop companion widget This addresses the \"lonely AI-first founder\" use case — turning AI tools from text interfaces into virtual teammates with presence.",
