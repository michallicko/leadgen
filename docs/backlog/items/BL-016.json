  "description": "Framework for modular, depth-selectable enrichment — the core of \"AI company due diligence.\" Users choose which enrichment modules to run (company profile, legal, signals, news) and at what depth (quick scan vs full DD). Includes: module registry (pluggable enrichment stages), depth selector UI in dashboard, credit cost estimation before execution, progress tracking per module, and results viewer. Each module is a Python pipeline stage (via BL-015) that can be run independently or in combination.",
