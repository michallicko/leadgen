  "description": "All AI chat responses on the playbook page display raw markdown syntax instead of rendered HTML. Bold text shows as literal **text**, headings as ## Heading, tables as pipe characters |col|col|, and horizontal rules as ---.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Login to staging, navigate to /visionvolve/playbook\n2. In AI chat, type any question (e.g., 'What is account-based marketing?')\n3. Read the AI response\n4. Observe raw markdown characters: **, ##, ---, | visible as literal text\n\n### Expected\n- AI responses render as formatted HTML (bold text, headings, bullet lists, tables)\n- react-markdown or equivalent library processes markdown to HTML\n- No visible **, ##, or | characters in rendered output\n\n### Actual\n- All markdown syntax displayed as literal plain text\n- No HTML rendering whatsoever\n- DOM inspection shows no markdown-related CSS classes or components\n\n### Root Cause Hypothesis\nreact-markdown was added as a dependency (PR #38) but the ChatMessage component is not using it to render AI responses. Either the component code was not deployed, or the markdown wrapper is not applied to the AI message content.",
