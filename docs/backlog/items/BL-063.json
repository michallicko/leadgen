  "description": "Auto-save is completely non-functional on staging (commit d2c4e67). Typing in the strategy editor produces no save indicator, fires no PUT/PATCH network requests to /api/playbook, and Cmd+S has no effect. Content typed into the editor is lost on page refresh. API confirms version is unchanged after edits.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Login to staging, navigate to /visionvolve/playbook\n2. Click into the strategy editor\n3. Type any text (e.g., 'Testing auto-save feature')\n4. Wait 5+ seconds — no 'Saving...' or 'Saved' indicator appears\n5. Press Cmd+S — no effect\n6. Check Network tab in DevTools — no PUT/PATCH to /api/playbook\n7. Refresh the page — typed content is gone\n\n### Expected\n- 'Saving...' indicator appears ~1.5s after typing stops\n- Network PUT request fires to /api/playbook\n- Content persists after page refresh\n- Cmd+S triggers immediate save\n\n### Actual\n- No indicator, no network requests, no persistence\n- The Save button was correctly removed (that part works)\n\n### Root Cause Hypothesis\nAuto-save code from PR #36 (feature/playbook-autosave) may not be deployed to staging, or the debounced save handler is not wired to the editor's onChange event.",
