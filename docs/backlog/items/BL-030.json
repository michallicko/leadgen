  "description": "Unified email sending via Resend with two delivery modes: - **Platform mode**: Tenant verifies a sending subdomain (e.g., `outreach.acme.com`) on our Resend Scale account. We manage sending, they add 2 DNS records. Good for users without existing Resend. - **BYOK mode**: If tenant's root domain is already claimed in another Resend account, they connect their own Resend API key. We validate their domain is verified, then send through their account directly. Zero cost to us, full root-domain sending for them. Two use cases: (1) **Transactional** — enrichment notifications, import status, staleness alerts, weekly digests, account emails. (2) **Outreach delivery** — personalized emails to contacts, tracks opens/clicks/bounces, complements Lemlist. Data model: `tenant_email_configs` table (mode, domain, subdomain, encrypted API key, verification status). Send logic checks mode and uses the appropriate Resend API key. Domain conflict auto-detected on registration attempt.",
