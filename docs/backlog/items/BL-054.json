  "spec": "## Chat Access to Self-Company Enrichment Data\n\n### Goal\nGive the playbook chat full access to the tenant's own company enrichment data (L1, L2, profile, signals, market, legal), achieving parity with what onboarding uses.\n\n### Gap Analysis\nThe onboarding flow runs L1+L2 enrichment and seeds the strategy doc. The chat loads enrichment via `_load_enrichment_data()`, but:\n- **20+ L2 fields missing**: pitch_framing, revenue_trend, industry_pain_points, relevant_case_study, regulatory_pressure, employee_sentiment, ma_activity, digital_maturity_score, and more\n- **No fallback**: If strategy doc has no enrichment_id but a self-company exists, chat gets zero context\n- **No on-demand detail**: Detailed signals, legal, market data not accessible\n\n### Phase 1 (No Dependencies)\n- Expand `_load_enrichment_data()` to include pitch_framing, revenue_trend, industry_pain_points, relevant_case_study\n- Add fallback: if no enrichment_id, look up `is_self=True` company\n- Add new prompt sections: Strategic Positioning, Industry Context, Proof Points\n\n### Phase 2 (Requires AGENT)\n- `get_company_research(section)` tool for on-demand access to detailed data\n- Sections: legal, signals_detail, market_detail, opportunity_detail, strategic, tech_detail\n- Enrichment status awareness in system prompt\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- Given L2 enrichment is complete, system prompt includes pitch_framing, revenue_trend, industry_pain_points, relevant_case_study\n- Given no enrichment_id but is_self company exists, chat auto-links and loads data\n- Given no enrichment data exists, AI mentions research hasn't been done\n- Given AGENT is enabled and user asks about hiring signals, AI calls get_company_research('signals_detail')",
  "description": "Give the playbook chat full access to the tenant's own company enrichment data (L1, L2, profile, signals, market, legal). Phase 1 (no deps): expand `_load_enrichment_data()` to include pitch_framing, revenue_trend, industry_pain_points, relevant_case_study in the system prompt; add fallback self-company lookup when strategy doc has no enrichment_id. Phase 2 (requires AGENT): `get_company_research(section)` tool for on-demand access to detailed signals, market, legal, and opportunity data. Achieves parity between onboarding and chat contexts.",
