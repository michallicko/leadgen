  "spec": "## Phase UI (Routing+Stepper+TopBar)\n\n### Goal\nBuild the frontend routing, phase stepper navigation, and top bar to support the multi-phase playbook workflow.\n\n### Scope\n- **React Router**: `/strategy/:id/phase/:type` routes\n- **Phase Stepper**: Horizontal step indicator showing all 4 phases with current/completed/locked states\n- **Top Bar**: Strategy name, phase stepper, and action buttons (Save, AI Chat toggle)\n- **Phase transitions**: Click stepper to navigate; locked phases show tooltip \"Complete previous phase first\"\n- **Responsive**: Stepper collapses to dropdown on mobile\n\n### Technical Approach\n- `PhaseLayout` wrapper component with stepper + content area\n- `usePhasesQuery(strategyId)` React Query hook\n- Stepper component: 4 circles connected by lines, filled/outlined/locked states\n- CSS transitions for stepper state changes\n- Depends on PB-001 for phase API\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- Given a strategy with 4 phases, the stepper shows all phases with correct states\n- Given the user clicks a completed phase, navigation occurs\n- Given the user clicks a locked phase, a tooltip explains the prerequisite\n- Given mobile viewport, the stepper collapses to a dropdown selector",
