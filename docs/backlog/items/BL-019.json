  "description": "Two-tier check to determine whether a contact still works at their listed company. Tier 1 (fast/cheap): email deliverability probe via BL-013 — if work email bounces, flag as likely departed. Tier 2 (thorough): AI research via Perplexity/Claude for inconclusive cases — checks LinkedIn profile, company website, recent news. Returns confidence score + evidence summary. Runnable on-demand per contact or in batch via the pipeline engine. Updates contact record with verification status and last-verified date.",
