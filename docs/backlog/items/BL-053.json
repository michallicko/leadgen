  "spec": "## Echo Task List — Living Prioritized Task Board\n\n### Goal\nTransform the Echo tab into a living, constantly-prioritized task list. Tasks come from three sources: manual user tasks, AI-generated recommendations, and system alerts.\n\n### Task Sources\n- **Manual**: User creates via chat (\"remind me to follow up with Acme\") or UI (Add Task button)\n- **AI-generated**: Proactive suggestions from strategy analysis, enrichment results, campaign performance\n- **System alerts**: Pipeline completions, send failures, import results, stale data warnings\n\n### Chat Tools (Requires AGENT)\n- `add_task(title, description, priority, due_date, linked_entity)` — Create a task\n- `update_task(task_id, fields)` — Update priority, due date, description, status\n- `complete_task(task_id)` — Mark as done\n- `get_prioritized_tasks(limit)` — Get sorted task list for AI reasoning\n- `suggest_tasks(focus_area)` — Analyze strategy/campaigns/enrichment and suggest new tasks\n\n### Data Model\n- `tasks` table: id, tenant_id, user_id, title, description, source, priority, status, due_date, snoozed_until, linked_entity_type, linked_entity_id, ai_context (JSONB), dedup_key (unique per tenant)\n- Sources: manual, ai_strategy, ai_enrichment, ai_campaign, system\n- Priorities: critical, high, medium, low\n- Statuses: open, completed, dismissed, snoozed\n\n### API Endpoints\n- `GET /api/tasks` — List with filters (status, source, priority, linked_entity_type)\n- `POST /api/tasks` — Create (with dedup_key support for AI/system tasks)\n- `PATCH /api/tasks/:id` — Update fields\n- `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` — Hard delete\n- `POST /api/tasks/prioritize` — AI-powered reprioritization\n\n### UI\n- Grouped sections: Overdue, Today, Upcoming, Recently Completed\n- Task cards: priority indicator, source badge, due date, linked entity link, AI context (expandable)\n- Actions: Done, Snooze (tomorrow/next week/next month/custom), Dismiss\n- Filters: All, Overdue, High Priority, AI Suggested, System\n- Empty state with onboarding CTA\n\n### Integration Points\n- Pipeline completion → system task\n- Email/LinkedIn send failure → system task\n- Strategy gap analysis → AI task\n- Campaign performance drop → AI task\n- Stale tasks (>14 days) get visual badge\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- Given user says \"remind me to call Acme Thursday\", AI creates task with due date\n- Given enrichment completes, system task appears with results summary\n- Given 10 open tasks, list is sorted: overdue first, then by priority and due date\n- Given user clicks Done, task moves to Recently Completed section\n- Given user asks \"what should I focus on?\", AI returns top tasks with reasoning\n- Given duplicate dedup_key, existing task is refreshed instead of creating duplicate",
  "description": "The Echo tab becomes a living, constantly-prioritized task list. Tasks from three sources: (1) manual user tasks captured from chat or UI, (2) AI-generated tasks from strategy analysis, enrichment results, and campaign performance, (3) system alerts from pipeline events, send failures, and import completions. Chat tools: `add_task`, `update_task`, `complete_task`, `get_prioritized_tasks`, `suggest_tasks`. Dedup prevents duplicate AI/system tasks. Priority sort: overdue first, then by priority level and due date. Snooze, dismiss, and complete lifecycle. Linked entities navigate to company/campaign/contact detail views.",
