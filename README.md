# Leadgen Pipeline

Multi-tenant B2B lead enrichment and outreach platform. Ingests company/contact lists, runs AI-powered enrichment through a multi-stage pipeline, generates personalized outreach messages, and provides a dashboard for review and management.

## Architecture

```
Browser (Dashboard)  ──→  Caddy  ──→  Flask API  ──→  PostgreSQL (RDS)
                           │
Pipeline Control     ──→  n8n webhooks  ──→  Airtable (workflow data)
```

- **Dashboard**: Vanilla HTML/JS/CSS at `leadgen.visionvolve.com/{namespace}/`
- **API**: Flask + SQLAlchemy + Gunicorn (Docker container)
- **Orchestration**: n8n (self-hosted) for enrichment pipeline workflows
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on AWS RDS, multi-tenant with `tenant_id`

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for full details.

## Development Workflow

This project follows **spec-driven development**:

1. Write a spec in `docs/specs/` before coding
2. Create a feature branch (`feature/{name}`)
3. Write tests against the spec
4. Implement until tests pass
5. Update docs and changelog
6. Merge to `main` when complete

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for full rules.
